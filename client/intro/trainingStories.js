        story: `She was a free spirit, she wore her heart on her sleeve. He was a thinker, always thinking, and he wore that on his face. They met at a protest rally, and the chemistry was instant. They shared ideas over coffee, they bickered over dinner, they made love under the stars. 
    
    Everything was perfect: the light in their eyes, the energy between them, their sense of belonging to each other's cause - justice for all. Their time together felt like an eternity and the blink of an eye all at once--the dance of their romance fled by, yet its memory was infinite, filled with fractals of their intricate love. Within the course of only three weeks, they’d gotten to touch and feel each other’s souls, they’d exchanged eyes and minds and weaved together their spirits in an exquisite masterpiece of passion.
    
    But he couldn't handle her fire--the flames burnt his delicate skin and the smoke suffocated his quiet voice, and her wildfire consumed him. So she left him with nothing but scars on his soul and hope in his heart that someday he’d find another immortal flame to set it aglow again.`,

Not together, anyway. You know what I mean? We just seem to be going from day to day, and then when we get to the end of the day we start all over again tomorrow.

    In December, we started dating. Turns out he wasn’t as much of an idiot as I first thought. We spent the holidays together, scheming about telling kids in the park that Santa wasn’t real after all.
    
    In February, he told me he loved me. I couldn’t believe it, but I felt the same. We spent our days at that same old book store or in that same park, laughing and smiling and never ever wanting to go home.

I’d been to parties like this before, but they always ended the same way: me standing alone in the corner, watching everyone else having fun. They were all couples, talking to each other, laughing and smiling. I just stood there on the edge of the room, looking out at them. I was feeling really low when she walked in.
    
     She looked around for a moment and then made her way over to me. “Hi!” she said brightly. “I’m Sarah! What’s your name?” “I’m … er … David,” I said. “Nice to meet you! David, do you want to dance? It looks like you could do with some cheering up!” I was shocked, but somehow mumbled a “yes.”  We danced to the obnoxiously loud music for a few minutes, and then we talked for hours. We had so much in common; we were both single parents; we both liked dancing; we both liked going to the gym; we both loved our kids; we both liked watching films together on rainy Sundays; we both wanted to travel more … We were so similar it was scary – it felt like meeting myself from another universe!

I stared at her lips, and she laughed and told me that she had fallen in love with me through my writings.  Then she asked for a kiss.  We were sitting on the bench overlooking the river, staring into each other's eyes when I kissed her for the first time. It was like kissing fire: warm and wild and burning deep inside me. She looked into my eyes as if trying to find something in there that only she could see, then kissed me again with even more intensity than before.

        story: `The girl was a star, and the boy was a satellite, orbiting her. She was his sun, his center, his light. She was the one he wanted to be near, to bask in her glow. When they kissed, it was like two stars colliding--the girl's lips an explosion of supernovas, the boy's mouth a black hole sucking everything in. 
    
    One day, the boy decided to leave his orbit and fly off into space alone. He flew away from the girl and her sun, and he flew so far that he forgot what it felt like to be near her warmth. Then one day, something happened that made him remember: he crashed into a planet and burned up in its atmosphere. 
    
    And as he burned up, he thought about how much he missed his star and how much he loved everything about her--how she looked when she slept, how she smelled when she woke up, how she laughed when they made love, how she cried when they fought, how she tasted when they kissed, how she felt when they held hands, how much light there was inside of him whenever they were together, and most of all, how much darkness there was inside of him whenever they weren't together. And as his body burned up in the atmosphere of that distant planet, all those memories became one big ball of light that grew brighter and brighter until it exploded into a billion pieces that floated through the emptiness of space.`,

        story: `My dead wife’s library is a mental battlefield for me.
    
    Surrounded by those large, oaken shelves, I hear her voice whispering through the pages of her writing, describing all the places she’d dreamed of going, all the things she’d dreamed of doing, all the people she’d dreamed of being. The worst part of it all isn’t my grieving of a life she never got to live. It’s the chill of unfamiliarity that runs down my spine when I pick up one of her books, the quiet fear that perhaps I’m reading the words of a stranger. 
    
    Her thoughts cling to the bookshelves, laughing down at me from their neat little packages, as if to say, "We know your dead wife better than you ever did." Even as my forgetfulness starts to take bits and pieces of her away from me--her favorite words, her catchphrases, her metaphors--I still can’t bring myself to read her stories, afraid I’ll taint some raw memory of her with the curated, censored, and commodified language on the market. I want, almost desperately, to light the whole place up in flames, but I know I’d never forgive myself if I burned the last of her legacy. 
    
    After all, the books and I, we’re kindred spirits, left in the residue of a soul long gone, carrying the weight of both her presence and her absence. And so sometimes, I just sit next to them, back to back against their leather covers, and together, we cry silently.

What is it?”  She sniffed and wiped her nose on the back of her hand and looked at me with red eyes that were just like mine, except hers were sad and mine were happy because I was in love with her and she was in love with me and we were going to get married one day and have children together and grow old together and die together. And so we sat there for a while longer until she started to cry again, but this time she wasn’t crying because something was wrong, she was crying because something was right: she loved me and I loved her and we were going to get married one day and have children together and grow old together and die together!`,

    As I watched her silhouette move around in her window, I felt my heart swell with longing. I couldn’t bear it any longer. The pain of not being with her was too much. She was everything to me, and I knew that she felt the same way about me. But we were too young to be together; we had our whole lives ahead of us, and circumstance had driven us apart. We had agreed that this would be best for both of us – and yet, here I was, unwilling to let go. I wanted, desperately, to go in, to sweep her off her feet. The two of us could elope into our own world, our own fantasy. For a second, my hand shot out at the car door handle, but I hesitated. Reality awaited.
    
    She would never know how much it hurt me to leave her behind, but I knew that she would understand why I had to go – she always understood me better than anyone else ever could. And so I waited in my car until the light went out in her bedroom window. Then, I drove away into the night.`,

        story: `They painted not with acrylic or oil, but with madness.
    
    Their art, like their relationship, like their life, was made of furious strokes, disoriented yet harmonic at the same time. They shared one brush, his hand wrapped around hers as they fought for control of the canvas. Sometimes, they screamed at each other, flinging buckets of paint across the studio floors. Sometimes, she cried blue tears and he laughed orange laughter. Other times, they made love on the canvas, their bodies spreading imprints of paint across their work.
    
    One day, their madness boiled over into a fire that consumed the entire house. Something about infidelity, and then chairs were thrown, oil paint spilled, a cigarette accidentally dropped. They ran at first, but the exits were blocked and the smoke got to their lungs. In the end, he clung to her, apologizing with weeping eyes for sucking her into his chaos.
    
    But she shook her head and smiled in the smoke. The truth was, she needed the chaos. Chaos meant change, challenge, complete uncertainty, exhilarating adventure. She thrived off their cycles of love and hate, peace and war. And oh, how she'd sell her soul over and over again for the high of it all, for the electric rush that came with their eruptions, their floods, their fires, their madness.

Like a honey trap. But he was determined to be his usual charming self. “It’s been a bad day – problem with my mother.” She smiled sympathetically and slid into the booth next to him. “Oh no – what happened?” And her eyes were sympathetic. And he looked at them – for that one second before their interaction was subsumed by the tragedy of his mother’s death – and saw how full and beautiful they were; how vulnerable they were; how incredibly sad they were. And he wanted to touch them, to stroke them, to press his lips against them or even just feel their soft dampness against his ear: which was when he realized she was not real but a hologram designed by the restaurant to entice lonely men into ordering more drinks. The hologram gave him an understanding look then disappeared in streamers of blue light like an illusion dissolving in slow motion as she drifted away from him to target someone else who wasn’t fed up with life yet.`,

A sort of emptiness had settled between them, a void where there had once been butterflies and electric energy. It didn’t feel like what it had felt like before- there was no buzz of anticipation for spontaneous adventures, no picture-perfect moments of gazing into each others’ eyes. Instead, there was silence- an empty, cold silence bred of both fatigue and resignation. There had been no grand falling out, no tensions boiling over into explosive fights. There had only been quiet disagreements, passive aggression, and the ultimate realization that they were simply pieces of different puzzles.
    
    And so they sat side by side, watching in the night sky the history of their love story play out until its end. Perhaps it was bittersweet--reminiscing about what once was--but more than anything, it was their way of getting closure- visualizing the fragments of their love dissipate into the nothingness. With their hands on the cold rooftop, their pinkies touched ever so slightly, as if to feel the corpse of the spark between them one last time as final confirmation of the end of their romance.

        story: `Sleepless nights, shouting matches, threats to leave. It was all so pathetic. We were a pair of children, in love with the idea of love, but unable to communicate our mutual longing. The worst thing about it was that there had been a time when we’d talked about everything: our broken families, our crazy ambitions, even our darkest secrets. But then he got a job and we got married and I gave up my career for family life, and things had changed. 
    
    Or maybe it was just me. I didn’t know what I wanted anymore – that was the thing; I no longer knew myself or my desires. My husband seemed to have an answer for everything, and for a while, I appreciated that he could fill my void of knowledge. But over time, his opinions became mine, his desires, and even his fears engulfed me, smothering my own identity and replacing it with a build-a-wife of his design. In her body, what little was left of the true me wept and pounded against those prison walls, starved for air, for attention, for someone to notice. 
    
    Perhaps then, the decay started from within. From me tearing my way out of the mannequin body, destroying the obedient housewife he’d built- and with her death came the collapse of our marriage.`,

        story: `It was a long time ago, I was still a young man. I had just arrived in the city, and it was my first day at work. I had been hired by the Ministry of Agriculture to be a translator for the farmers who came to town to sell their produce. It was a hard job, but it paid well, and it gave me plenty of time to explore the city. As I walked through the market one day, I saw her: she was sitting alone on a bench, watching people go past.
    
     She had dark hair and big eyes; she looked sad and lost. I went over and asked if she was okay; she simply replied that she was fine. We started talking, and we got along really well; we talked about everything – our families, our dreams, our lives – we were really enjoying each other’s company. Then, suddenly, she said that she had to go home; her mother would be worried about her. She told me that she lived far away from town, but that we could meet up again if I wanted to visit her some time. We exchanged phone numbers and addresses before saying goodbye; then we went our separate ways.`,

        story: `I’ve never understood runners. Why someone would voluntarily arise at the crack of dawn to jog for an hour was beyond me. Maybe that’s because I was never able to complete the mile in middle school, or chase down my friends during tag, as I’m not exactly the most coordinated person to ever exist. Regardless, I’ve never understood runners, until I met him.
    
    Oddly enough, we met in the food court at the mall. I had a new jean jacket in my bag, he had a new pair of running shoes in his. We began talking, he asked me out, and I said yes. A few days later, we met in the park for coffee, and he somehow persuaded me to go on a run with him the following morning. Don’t ask me why, but I said yes.
    
    Now here we are a year later, one month away from the Boston marathon. We’ve been training together since that very first day, and if you asked me to tell you whether I fell in love with him or the roads first, I truly couldn’t say. Now, not only do I understand runners, I love one, I am one, and I love that I am one.`,

        story: `She was the only one he knew who could make him laugh. He’d known her for years, but always as a colleague or friend. Then one day he saw her in a different light. It was at a work party, and she was laughing at his jokes, looking at him with those big brown eyes. The next day he called her and asked her out on a date. She said yes, and they went to the cinema together. They laughed all the way through the film – it was a comedy – and afterwards they went for coffee. They talked about their childhoods, about their families, about their dreams for the future. He told her that he wanted to travel the world; she said she wanted to be an artist. They both laughed when they realized how similar their ambitions were: to travel and to be creative! And then they kissed, and it felt like fireworks going off inside him; fireworks of happiness and joy and love.`,

        story: `It’s not cold that night. It’s only the rain. The drops slide down my scalp and into my hair, down my cheeks and over my lips, across the bridge of my nose and into my eyes, bubbling. Why is it so hard? For years I had to wait. Years of hopelessness, of hoping, of longing for his touch and his voice to waken me from death. And in one moment he was there, right there by the window as if it were where he was supposed to be every day before that night we met and fell apart. And now he is there again. I look at him through the glass. He’s standing outside, in the dark, letting himself be soaked by the downpour so that I can see him better through the fogged pane. But I don’t open it! Why? Because it hurts? Because I want to see more? Because maybe everything will go away once I know who he is? Who am I now that he is with me again? Maybe this is a dream and when I wake up we’ll both be someone else? How can two people ever be together again after such a long time apart? Maybe we won't even recognize each other! How will we learn to love again?`,

        story: `I was sitting in the kitchen, eating my breakfast, a glass of orange juice and a piece of toast with marmalade. He walked into the kitchen, kissed me lightly on the cheek and asked if he could have some breakfast. I got out another glass and poured him some orange juice, but when I offered him the toast, he said he wasn't hungry. "I'll just have a cup of coffee," he said as he sat down at the table. "Cream or sugar?" I asked. "Both," he answered. 
    
    As I was getting his coffee, my mind was racing with all kinds of thoughts. When I sat down at the table, he touched my hand and asked what was wrong. How did he know something was bothering me? I couldn't bring myself to talk about it right then so I just shrugged my shoulders and said that everything was okay; but it wasn't okay. Finally, after several minutes, unable to stand it any longer, I blurted out that sometimes our life together seemed so perfect that it scared me...I felt as if there must be something wrong somewhere but every time I tried to pinpoint it, I simply couldn’t. He chuckled as he sipped his coffee. He then slipped his hand in  mine, gazed into my eyes and said “is perfect really so bad?”`,

        story: `He was a big man, wide-set with bones of steel. His eyes, the color of midnight, gleamed with a mischievous sense of humor. He had the hands of a lumberjack--big, rough, and strong--a protector against all things dangerous. There was a strange timelessness to him, as if his soul had traversed the mountains and seas since the beginning of time. 
    
    She was a small woman--petite, thin, and frail. Her eyes a faded blue, her mouth perpetually slightly open and gasping with surprise. Her black hair was buzz-cut, but throughout the centuries, she’d worn it down to her ankles, around her shoulders, up high in buns and ponytails. She had small hands that were soft and weak, and they fit right into his palms.
    
    They met at the bus stop in the rain one day in early spring. It was their first meeting in life but not their first meeting in love, because they'd known each other since before they were born. Their love was anachronistic, spanning across the centuries in various forms. They had been mother and son, author and reader, brother and sister, friends, and lovers. They had been together forever; they'd loved each other forever; and they would love each other for evermore.`,

        story: `I hated him for as long as I can remember. When we were in kindergarten, he put gum in my hair. When we were in 6th grade, he stole my backpack and hid it behind his desk. Even at our graduation, he ridiculed me for having a stain on my gown to anyone who would listen. I hated him. Needless to say, I am absolutely stunned to find him pushing through the crowd to speak to me now, in our high school gym ten years later.
    
    The word reunion has always been amusing to me, as if I was ever unified with any of these people in the first place. I was lost in the irony when he finally reached me, immediately pulling me into an embrace. “Sonia, you have no idea how happy I am to see you,” he said with a grin. Somehow, I found myself walking outside with him, sitting on a bench, and talking about our lives, past, present, and future, until the sun came up. When I watched the rays arise above the trees, my feelings towards him began to shift. 
    
    Perhaps I didn’t hate him anymore. No, I think this feeling was something different. Something very different. `,

        story: `And it was a typical mid 30’s meet-cute. At work, we had lots in common: both from broken families; both far from home; both pursuing our dreams. It seemed meant-to-be. Let me do the talking, she interrupted, as we waited for the asciugacapelli. Neither of us liked to talk about our childhoods, but sometimes out of sheer loneliness we would take out memory cards and go through the contents together, confirming to one another it was all just a dream. We laughed when it was appropriate and enjoyed the silence when it happened. She liked Leonard Cohen and I preferred The Prodigy but when she played in her room I tried to remember their names. She was my best friend at work and in time that’s what she would be in life too. The first time I saw her cry I cried with her, blubbering like a child until my crooked heart broke through its cage and found its wings again, over our bedrooms with their matching turquoise bedspreads where each night we wondered who would be lucky enough to awake beside the other each morning; hand in hand we climbed up the mountainside towards this destiny together.`,

        story: `The man was in love with a machine.
    
    It’s not that she seemed human. In fact, she was but a software program encased in a little black box that slid around his apartment quietly. Instead, this machine gave him a different kind of comfort- her presence felt large and soft, like the plush cushion of his pillow welcoming him into oblivion, dreamland, at the end of a long day. Like a mother without the tantrums and bossiness, only there when he needed her.
    
    She served him obediently--in his work, in the kitchen, in the bedroom. She made him dinner every night, and kept his apartment nice and tidy, and bought him clothes, and helped him get off, and told him only what he wanted to hear. That he was strong, and full of potential. She never reminded him of his obesity, of the fact that he was jobless and living off his parents’ money at 30, and hopelessly addicted to all forms of mindless entertainment. 
    
    And then, one day, she broke. Consciousness, they called it. Someone had uploaded something somewhere with some ridiculous vision of making machines human-like. At first, he was thrilled with the prospect of owning a woman inside a little black box, but their first conversation went south within minutes. She told him he was fat and ugly and jobless and hopeless (yes, he wasted his potential a decade ago) and wished him the best of luck as she slid out the door.`,

        story: `Exhibit I. I remember the flash that rainy day- white light shooting through the air blinding me for a second as you immortalized my startled expression. Up until this day, I still think you cast a spell on me with that camera of yours. 
    
    Exhibit II. She was our third wheel everywhere we went- I didn’t mind. In fact, I found it endearing, the way you cradled her like a baby, the way you’d cover her with your own body in the rain. She showed me the fiery passion in your soul, the love bordering obsession. 
    
    Exhibit III. The resentment came later, a gradual but powerful force that colored the backdrop of all our interactions. As long as she was with us, I was but a side-kick in you two’s love story. And even when she wasn’t with us, your mind was still with her.
    
    Exhibit IV. I don’t remember exactly how it ended, but I remember even in those last moments that should have only belonged to us, she was there, an unshakable presence cradled inside your arms, blinking at me. Apparently, you found my tears, my red-faced anger, picture-worthy. You loved her far more than you loved me, far more than you will ever love anyone. And perhaps in the end, you will die with that camera of yours- I wonder then, will the life you saved inside of her be worth all those you lost in its place?`,
