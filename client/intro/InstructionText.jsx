              Lily was bored. It was Friday night and she had to be at the dance hall in half an hour, but she didn't want to go. She was tired of dancing every night and she didn't like the boys who were always asking her out. Max was there, though, and he always asked her to dance, so Lily decided to stay a little while longer. She liked Max. He was the only one who ever had a conversation with her, and she thought he might ask her out if she stayed long enough.<br/><br/>

              "Let's go for a walk," Max suggested as he came up to Lily. "It's hot in here."<br/><br/>

              "All right," Lily said gladly. "But I have to be back by ten."<br/><br/>

              They walked up and down the avenue, talking comfortably about everything and anything, until finally they found themselves looking at each other with amused grins on their faces.<br/><br/>

              "We've been through this before," Max said, indicating all that they had talked about on their walk up the avenue; then he added: "But isn't it funny how you can enjoy talking about yourself?"<br/><br/>

              "Yes," Lily admitted; "it is funny." Then she asked him: "What makes you think you know so much about me?"<br/><br/>

              Max laughed at her question: "What makes you think I know so much about myself?" he countered, but his question was not answered because suddenly they realized that they were in love and that everything else had been just talk before that moment when they stood looking at each other in the bright light of a street lamp on Friday night at eleven-thirty when everyone else was dancing and having fun but them...<br/><br/>

              Max and Lily were at a party. They were both bored. They sat on a sofa together.<br/><br/>

              "I'm sorry I'm boring you," Max said.<br/>
              "Don't be so silly," Lily said, "You’re not boring me at all!"<br/><br/>

              "Let's go for a walk," said Max.<br/>
              "Yes, let's," Lily answered.<br/><br/>

              So they went out for a walk in the dark street. It was spring and warm enough to walk without an overcoat. They walked very slowly, and they talked about themselves and their friends and what fun it was to be young and in love with somebody. Suddenly Max stopped walking and seized her by the arm. "I think I'm in love with you," he said, in amazement at himself or at her, or both of them together in the night under the trees that smelled like lilac and fresh bread.<br/><br/>

              Lily and Max met each other in a party. Then they talked and laughed and talked and laughed and talked and laughed and talked and laughed together.<br/><br/>

              <b>Copying a famous story</b>:
              It was 12 o'clock when Cinderella met the prince. He was tall, handsome man with a brown hair.<br/><br/>

              <b>Not making sense at all</b>:
              Lily met Max on Friday. Ten years later, they married. Then they divorced, and Lily fell in love with Eric.<br/><br/>
