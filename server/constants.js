Suddenly, Max walked up by her side. "I don't want to go in either," he said with a sigh.

Lily smiled at him; "Why not?" she asked curiously, but Max just shrugged his shoulders.
"It's Saturday tomorrow," Lily said after a moment of silence between them, "what are you going to do?"

"Read," he said simply, shoving his hands deep into his pockets.
"You're not going to read all day are you?" Lily laughed. "Besides, it's too hot in there for reading." Max laughed with her as they walked down the avenue together, talking about everything and anything until they found themselves looking`

"Hey," said Terry. "I just wanted to say that I think you're really pretty."

Caroline blushed and responded, "Thank you."
Terry asked if she wanted to get some coffee later, but Caroline told him she couldn't because of her class schedule.

The next day, Terry walked up to Caroline again in the hallway and they started talking. They both got coffee after class and hung out together for a while. They talked about their interests and who they wanted to be when they grew up.
Terry asked Caroline on a date later that week and she said yes. 
They ended up dating for 6 months until he broke her heart by cheating on her with his best friend's girlfriend`

"Oh, I know you do," she answered. "You're always trying to kiss me."

"That's because I love you."
"I think it's because you think I'm pretty."
"Well, aren't you?" he laughed. "And I love you for it."
“For being pretty?" she asked him with a smile. “How silly!"
“No," Max told her, “for not knowing that you are pretty." And he kissed her, right there on the corner where they were standing in the afternoon sun.

He put it into a frame. He bought a new shirt in order to match her eyes because they were blue like his. And one day when no one was at home, he kissed her picture because it was raining and no one could see him through glass of the rain-bow that she brought inside him with her blue eyes because she liked books and so did he; they both liked old books, especially those that had been written by writers who were dead for a long time as their love would be too.

The next day when no one was at home again, the woodpeckers outside were knocking on trees with their little beaks, but inside him everything was silent without her so he decided to cut out an oval piece of cardboard from an old box in order to make a frame which would be more beautiful than his love for paperbacks which nobody reads anymore except lovers of first editions who know what it means to kiss ink off paper while waiting for publishers' replies, or death...

"No, I don't," Lily answered.

Then Max said: "Let's go for a walk."

"All right," Lily agreed. So they went for a walk in the park where it was cool and dark. They were both feeling rather bored until suddenly Max put his arm around Lily's shoulders and gave her a gentle hug. It was a friendly hug and nothing more, but Lily felt as if she had just stopped breathing; then suddenly she grabbed hold of Max and they hugged each other all over the place in the dark park under the trees that smelled like lilac and fresh bread. And when it began to rain they ran home hand in hand...

Lily came walking up to him, a book under her arm. She put down her book next to his, and smiled when she saw that he had no glasses on and was looking straight at her face.
“Hello, Max," she said softly; "I haven't seen you for ages."
“Hello," Max said; "I've been busy – I'm almost finished my thesis."
“Oh, you're still working on that? You've been working so hard..." Lily sounded disappointed. “I thought you'd be happy now it's almost done."
“Yes," Max sighed; "I am happy." He sat up when he heard the playground bell ring loudly in the distance, over by the high-gabled school building with the tall clock tower that made a little face appear every time it struck two or four or six, but not on quarter hours – not enough time between strikes for its round-faced little face to make another appearance atop its almond-shaped body with its big hands pointing to the quarter hour...but that was later – much later...and now read on:

"Hello..." said the second stranger. He could tell that the first stranger was troubled and he wanted to help him.

"Hello..." said the first stranger, who wasn't so troubled anymore because someone was kind enough to talk to him. The second stranger asked him what was troubling him, so the first one told his story about his wife who had left him for another man. The second one commiserated with him and told how he sometimes went through similar experiences in his life as well, even though it had been a long time since he had last seen his wife. The first one found out that they were from two different countries, but they ended up spending all day talking and walking together, and went back to their hotels together that night before calling it a day. In another town they might have met in separate hotel rooms by themselves that night; but instead they were in one room talking, sharing their experiences with each other, commiserating together about love and life. They became friends on that day; not only because of similarity of circumstances but also because of kindness: giving your sympathy when it is needed most is something any human being can do for another human being, no matter where you come from or where you are going to...

She said yes because it was hot in the dance hall; then they walked over to his brother’s house and sat on the porch swing while they talked about how much more fun it is to do everything with someone you love; then Max told her he had something in his pocket that belonged to her, so he reached into his pocket and pulled out a little black box...

Lily played on, one movement after another, not heeding any of the sounds around her, until she played the last note. "There," she sighed. "That's it."

Max came up to her smilingly. "The music sounded exactly as I'd imagined it would," he said.

"And why shouldn't it?" Lily asked him lightly. "We wrote it together."

"Yes," Max agreed; then he added: "You know I love you."

"Why shouldn't you?" Lily countered; then she added: "And I love you too". Then they were both silent for they knew that they had said everything that needed to be said between them...

They discussed these subversive passages with one another for a while, and then they liked each other so much that they decided to get married.

At first John thought it was a pity that Mary was not a boy, because he thought that if she had been, she would have made an excellent friend for life; but on second thought he decided that this was not so bad after all. What he liked about Mary was her laughter, her softness and her hair which fell softly around her face; and as time went by, John realized that his wife was a girl after all.

"I'm glad you're my husband," Mary said once when they had been married for eight years and two children; "you always understand me." And John agreed with his wife. He often did understand her, although sometimes it seemed to him as if she were completely different from everyone else he had ever known.

One morning when John came into the kitchen where his wife was making breakfast for their children (who were now eight years old themselves), he said: "I think I'm going out of my mind", and his wife laughed softly as she put some eggs on a plate; then she looked up at him and touched him gently on the cheek to reassure him: "No you're not," she said tenderly; "you're not going out of your mind at all - you're growing up."

“Let's go for a walk," said Max. “Let's go to the cinema instead," Lily answered.
Lily and her best friend went to the cinema. It was the first time they went together without their boyfriends, and they enjoyed it very much. Their boyfriends were very jealous when they found out that they had gone to see a film without them, but they agreed with their girlfriends later that evening that it was fun to think about all these things that had happened between them: laughing at all those stupid stories they told each other; being in love with one another; liking each other enough to want to kiss each other...

There was a sign that said: "GOVERNMENT HOUSE" that led to an outside terrace and we sat down to get our breath back.

"I wonder if this is what it's like to be in love," I said looking up at the yellow brick buildings around us, "I'm sure I'm not but everything looks different suddenly."

"It's late summer," Rowena replied dreamily; "see how quiet it is? It doesn't look like Cambridge at all."

"It's probably because it's late," I said, still looking around me with my eyes shining. "Harvard Square must be much different at night."

"I bet it is," Rowena answered; then she turned to me—"Do you think either one of us will ever see Harvard Square again after today?" she asked me with her eyes as wide as if she were trying to catch a glimpse of her own future through them.

"I don't have a watch," the woman said after she glanced at her wrist. "But I can tell you what time it is by heart."

The man looked shocked at this statement, but since it was getting dark he said: "All right then, tell me what time it is by heart."

"It's quarter past three," she answered.

The man smiled and walked away without thanking her. He didn't believe that anyone could possibly know what time it was by heart at such a precise moment as half past three in the afternoon. The woman smiled too as she watched him walk away from her into the crowd. She knew that no one would ever ask her how she knew the time so precisely, because no one would believe that someone could have learned to tell clock time by heart, especially when the minutes were not matching up with the hours of a day; yet this was how other people thought about themselves all the time, thinking that they must look like everyone else if they're dressed in clothes with pockets or wallets or handbags that are made out of exactly these items - wallets and handbags - and nothing else...

"I love you," said Max to Lily. "I've been wanting to tell you for a long time."

"I love you too," said Lily back. Then she leaned over close to Max's face and whispered: "Let's go somewhere where nobody can see us."

"Then why don't we get married?" asked Max and in reply he received a kiss from Lily.

And he was a good friend, too: whenever someone came to his house who had nowhere else to go for the night, Moishe always had a place for him on the couch near the warm stove; and no one ever left his home hungry because Moishe always first of all sat down with his guests and ate what there was himself before feeding anyone else.
Moisey's friends all liked him: Shmuel who could do everything with his hands like carving and painting and making things; Yankel who could draw; Boris who could do magic tricks.

Every night when the show was over, Lily went out for a walk because she was restless after being on her feet most of the evening.

"You have to meet her yourself," Harry insisted.
“I would like to," Max agreed, "but I already have a steady girl and I don't want to cause any trouble."

"I don't think there's going to be any trouble," Harry said as he looked at his watch; "she should be here any minute now."
“Then why don't you wait for her at the door?" Max suggested. “I think I'll have another coffee.”
“All right," Harry answered, and he went out on the sidewalk to meet his girl. When she came walking toward him, Harry grabbed her arm and hurried her rather roughly into the coffee shop where she could best see Max. “That's my friend," he said, introducing them quickly; then he left at once without saying another word because he didn't want to miss a moment of his date with this exciting new girl who knew how to keep him waiting for over an hour before arriving with a mild apology.

Harry's friend was Alice, and when she saw Max sitting alone at their table in the coffee shop looking so very sad that it broke her heart (and this is why she had been so late), Alice sat down beside him without saying a word and without waiting for Harry's approval or permission...

"Name?" he asked as soon as she sat down at the counter where he could keep an eye on her.

"Yours first," Lily answered, taking pen from behind her ear and leaning forward over the counter.

Lily wrote Max on the top of her application form, then turned it around in order not to lose her place, when she discovered that Max was looking at her very strangely, so she looked up at him too, but his eyes seemed suddenly very far away -- like someone dreaming -- so Lily went back to staring at him with curiosity until finally: "Is there something wrong with you?"

He stared back at her without thinking about anything until she finally got up and came over to his table.

"Hello," said Max, looking at her even harder than before because this time she wasn't even pretending to look away from him either. "I don't know why I'm looking at you like this," he told her finally, "but you're the first person I've ever seen who doesn't make me feel lonesome."

"You feel lonesome?" Lily asked him in surprise; "why should anybody feel lonesome?"

They danced until it was time for her to go home, then they went outside together under the big street lamp which shone down on them from between two maple trees in spring bloom. The street light made them feel romantic, so they talked about love until they found themselves telling each other little things about themselves as if they had known each other for years. They were both lonely and unhappy, so their loneliness grew less as they walked together through the spring night which smelled like lilacs and fresh bread...

It was a warm June day and they were talking about everything – about how much they liked each other, and about how funny it was that they had not realized it before, but now that they did realize it, all they could think of was that they wanted to be together. They hugged each other and kissed each other.

They were in love with each other.`

content: `Max was sitting in a bar nursing a beer. He was not in the mood to talk to anyone. When the bartender came up to him, he raised his eyebrows and pointed at his drink. Max would be there all night if they left him alone. It was too early for the place to be crowded. A few people came in, looked around and left again, but Max didn't notice any of them or he didn't care if he did. At that moment, someone tapped him on the shoulder and asked: "Mind if I join you?"

Max shook his head. "Have a seat," he said.

The man took off his coat and sat down on a stool next to Max's barstool; then reached for the paper lying on the bar, looked at it for a while, folded it up again and threw it down onto the counter with disgust saying: "What kind of town is this anyway?"

"What do you mean?" Max asked him; "there's nothing wrong with this town."

"Oh yeah?" said the man; "what would you say this town needs? Tell me that." He had started talking with passion in his voice; now he had both elbows on the counter and looked around like someone who was about to deliver a speech.

Max shrugged his shoulders. "I'm not from here," he said. "But what kind of town do you want? A good place for business maybe? What do you do anyway?" He had become interested in this man who had come into the bar so suddenly that`

"Let's go for a walk," Max suggested to Lily; but she refused because she knew the boys would follow them.
“I'm sorry," Lily said, "but I don't feel like going for a walk."

“I'll call you tomorrow," said Max; then he went away.

Lily felt embarrassed and humiliated, but she hadn't expected anything else. She had been asking for it by going out with a boy like Max. Everybody knew that he wasn’t good enough for her, but Lily thought she knew better than other people – not better than her parents, but certainly better than all those girls who giggled behind her back when they saw her with him on the street or in the movies or at the tennis club where they played tennis every Sunday with all those boys who were so good-looking and had such nice cars. And now here she was in this stupid party, half drunk and surrounded by silly boys who never left her alone and who thought their being there made a difference to her – if they didn't think that themselves! – and one of them even dared to touch her! And nobody helped her! Everybody looked on as if it were funny! Even those girls who giggled behind her back would have come to her rescue if they'd happened`

content: `I had to collect the money. It was late and I did not want to go to the office, but I wanted that money, so I went. The corridors were dark and empty, but my night-watchman knew me and let me in.

I walked along the corridor quickly past the rows of doors with their frosted-glass panels. Each door was labeled with a name plate. The letters were not very clear in the dim light of the corridor; I had to squint at them. When I reached my office, I had to knock at first; but Mrs. Russell opened the door right away because she had been waiting for me behind it for quite some time already. She looked upset and told me that she'd put off going home for as long as she could just because she was afraid that something would happen to her before she saw me again. She told me again how much she loved me and asked me if there wasn't anything we could do about it -- but there wasn't, so we both tried not to think about it anymore after that night...

content: `Lily and Max were in a train. They had just had dinner and were now drinking wine and talking about what a good time they'd just had on their vacation in Greece where they'd rented a yacht and sailed around the islands.

Suddenly, Max broke off his story to look at Lily and hold her hand. "I love you," he said.
"I love you, too," Lily answered, smiling happily, "And I'm so glad we're going away together on vacation again."
"What do you mean?" Max asked in surprise: "We didn't go anywhere together during our vacation."
“Yes we did," Lily said. "That day when we rowed out to the middle of the Aegean Sea and I fell overboard and nearly sank before you fished me out--that was really an interesting day!"
